Registry

Intro:

    * Windows is the only OS that uses a registry. Linux hides txt files and doesn't want user seeing registry files
    * In Linux, everything is a txt file
    * Registry is a centralized database

What is the Windows Registry?:

    * Complex hierarchical database that contains values that affect how OS works.
    * 15 to 20 megabytes - LOADED INTO RAM - designed for very fast reads and writes
    * Stored on hard drive is known as registry Hives
    * Contains keys and values; keys are container objects similar to folders, values are non-container objects similar to files.
    * Contains 5 main keys:
        1. HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT "HKCR" (contains information about registered applications, such as file associations, practically deprecated and kept for backwards compatibility)
        2. HKEY_CURRENT_USER "HKCU" (current user logged in)
        3. HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE "HKLM" (contains 7 subkeys and is MOST CRITICAL KEY):

            - SAM (Security Accounts Manager) - holds all usernames and passwords, 6000 variations used to crack file
            - Security (accessible only by admin)
            - System (boot process and kernel functions)
            - Software (3rd party software settings)
            - Hardware (created dynamically during boot)
            - Components
            - BCD_dat (in the \boot folder in the system partition)

        4. HKEY_USERS (used if more than one user logged on, for example, on a server)
        5. HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG "HKCC" (contains information gathered at runtime; information stored temporarily or permanently on disk)

Data stored in the registry:

        * String values Unicode
        * Binary data
        * Unsigned integers
        * Symbolic links
        * Multi-string values
        * Resource list (Plug and Play)
        * Resource descriptor (Plug and play)
        * 64-Bit Integers

Registry is located at Windows/System32/Config

User hive is stored in NTUSERDAT

.NET Framework applications use XML files for configuration
Portable applications keep configuration data in folder where exe files live (usually in flashdrive)

Control panel is where all tools are at and where users can safely modify configurations

Regedit is for technicians
